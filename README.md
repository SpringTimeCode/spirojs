# SpiroJS - Animated Spiral Circle Graphs

This code generates animated spiral circle graphs using sine and cosine trigonometry functions.  It uses JavaScript, Font Awesome, and BootStrap 5.

This will run locally without the need of a web server.  Just download, extract, and open the index.html file.

This is code converted from my original 1982 Commodore 64 Basic program.
