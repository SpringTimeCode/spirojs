# SpiroJS - Circle Graphs

This code generates circle graphs using sine and cosine trigonometry functions.  This code uses JavaScript, Canvas, and BootStrap 5.

This will run locally without the need of a web server.  Just download, extract, and open the index.html file.

This is code converted from my original 1982 Commodore 64 Basic program.
